## Contains Example Code on 2 meter type drawables, one is a standard 'thermometer' type fill gauge, and the other is a radial gauge.

### Definitely more work to do on making the positioning of the elements more "responsive", but I think it's a pretty good start. I did the hard part which was the math on the radial needle :)
